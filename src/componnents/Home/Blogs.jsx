                we store them on the client side?</h1>
            <br />
            <p>Here's a simplified flow of how a refresh token works: Initial login: The user logs in through a client application, which authenticates the credentials against an authentication server. Token issuance: Once authenticated, the server issues both an access token and a refresh token to the client.</p>

                What is express js? What is Nest JS ?
            </h1>
            <br />
            <p> ExpressJS is flexible and lets you do things your way. NestJS, on the other hand, uses TypeScript and has a structured approach, making it easy to read and scale. The differences, from how they're built to their guides, show what each is good at.</p>

<h1> Explain your code.</h1>
